# 30 Days DevOps Challenge - Weather Dashboard
## Day 1: Building a weather data collection system using AWS S3 and OpenWeather API

### Weather Data Collection System - DevOps Day 1 Challenge

### Project Overview
This project is a Weather Data Collection System that demonstrates core DevOps principles by combining:

* External API Integration (OpenWeather API)
* Cloud Storage (AWS S3)
* Infrastructure as Code
* Version Control (Git)
* Python Development
* Error Handling
* Environment Management

### Features
* Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities
* Displays temperature (Â°C), humidity, and weather conditions
* Automatically stores weather data in AWS S3
* Supports multiple cities tracking
* Timestamps all data for historical tracking

### Technical Architecture
* Language: Python 3.x
* Cloud Provider: AWS (S3)
* External API: OpenWeather API

#### Dependencies:
boto3 (AWS SDK)
python-dotenv
requests

## Code Explanation 
This script defines a WeatherDashboard class that interacts with both the OpenWeather API and AWS S3 to fetch and store weather data for specific cities. Here's a quick summary:

Imports: Essential libraries for interacting with the environment variables (os, dotenv), AWS S3 (boto3), making HTTP requests (requests), and working with JSON and date-time data.

Environment Setup: It loads environment variables using load_dotenv() for sensitive info like the API key and AWS bucket name.

Class Initialization: The WeatherDashboard class initializes with an OpenWeather API key and an S3 bucket name, setting up an S3 client using boto3.

Bucket Creation: In the create_bucket_if_not_exists method, the script checks if the S3 bucket exists and creates it if not.

Fetch Weather Data: The fetch_weather method queries the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather information for a given city and returns the response as JSON.

Save Data to S3: The save_to_s3 method saves the fetched weather data to an S3 bucket, appending a timestamp to the file name and ensuring the data is saved as a JSON object.

Main Execution: In the main() function, the script initializes a WeatherDashboard object, creates the S3 bucket if needed, and fetches and prints weather data for a predefined list of cities ("Toronto", "Ottawa", "Barrie"). The weather data is also saved to S3.

Execution Check: The script runs the main() function if executed directly.

This code allows the automated fetching, display, and storage of weather data for specified cities.
